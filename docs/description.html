  Ti<i>k</i>Z-Feynman is a LaTeX package allowing Feynman diagrams to be easily
  generated within LaTeX with minimal user instructions and without the need of
  external programs. It builds upon the Ti<i>k</i>Z package and leverages the graph
  placement algorithms from Ti*k*Z in order to automate the placement of many
  vertices. Ti<i>k</i>Z-Feynman still allows fine-tuned placement of vertices so that
  even complex diagrams can still be generated with ease.
